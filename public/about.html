<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently employed with Sierra Space doing IT work but I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering.
  In 2019 I married my amazing wife, Sarah. In October 2020 we had our first child Elizabeth.
  I have a passion for music, I love going out to the movies, and loving gaming with my other dad friends.

  My hope when I graduate is to either stick in IT but apply myself as a change control specialist implementing GIT changes within PLM and MES systems
  or to switch over to a software specific position. I currently work remote and am considering developing webpages for local businesses in my area gratis
  to build my rapport\Portfolio. Eventually to market myself as an alternative to SquareSpace for locals who would rather pay a one time fee instead of a
  monthly or yearly rates.
