<h1>Troy's Top Sci-Fi Movies</h1>
<h2>A nonhierarchical collection of science fiction films I've liked over the years and why</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Fifth Element</h3>
    <p>A space opera with an alien performing an opera that established a very unhealthy crush in foreign red heads, cemented my fondness for weird and quirky yet serious and epic narratives, and is also a core memory film that I saw with my dad when I was a kid.</p>
<h3>V For Vendetta</h3>
    <p>Less Sci-Fi and almost more nonfiction these days, but a lone idealist standing against tyranny to do what is right for all? Hard to pass up, some of its message gets lost focusing on weird bits, but still a fantastic tale of sacrifice for liberty.</p>
<h3>Children of Men</h3>
    <p>Loved this film. Great cast, great premise, and a dystopian setting complete with noire-style ending.</p>
<h3>Equilibrium</h3>
    <p>Look, The Matrix inspired a lot of 'cyberpunk' adjacent films. This is Fahrenheit 451 with Christian Bale and gun kata, is the story deeper? Subjectively yes. Is the world more unique? Not really. Is it pretentious and try to be more than it is on the tin? Nope!</p>
<h3>Star Wars: Rogue One</h3>
    <p>Plain and simple. The Star Wars franchise hasn't been good since the OG trilogy. The only good things to come out of Lucas' franchise since is The Mandolorian and this gem. 'I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me'</p>
